This directory contains patches that were added locally
on top of the NSS release.

remove-turktrust-bug-827543.patch: Tentatively remove TURKTRUST certificates
                                   from B2G 1.0 branch only, pending final
                                   decision for all products.
bug-834091.patch: Add SEC_PKCS7VerifyDetachedSignatureAtTime, which is needed
                  for B2G 1.0. This patch is probably going to be modified
                  before it can land in upstream NSS.
